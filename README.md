# Applied Generative AI 

This repository contains assignments, notebooks, and projects completed as part of the **Applied Generative AI** course.

The course covers the complete journey from foundational concepts to advanced generative models, including:

* Machine Learning (ML)
* Deep Learning (DL)
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Large Language Models (LLMs)
* Applied Generative AI techniques

Each notebook includes hands-on implementations, experiments, and practical applications of the concepts learned throughout the course.

## Goals

* Build strong foundations in ML & DL
* Understand NLP and transformer architectures
* Work with LLMs and generative AI models
* Apply GenAI techniques to real-world problems
